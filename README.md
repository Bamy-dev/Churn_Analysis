# Churn_Analysis
The measure of how many customers stop using the product or service of a telecommunication company.
Churn = the measure of how many customers stop using a product or service. Churn can be measured based on actual usage or failure to renew (when the product is sold using a description model). Often evaluated for a specific period of time, there can be monthly,quarterly or annual churn rate.

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model, that will predict the number of customers in this telecoms industry who have 'churned' and the factors that affect churn in this telecoms industry.
